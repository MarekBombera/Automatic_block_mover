# Automatic Block Mover

- Use arrows to sequence where the block should move
- Press space to release the sequence
- Press R to reset the block position
- Click on the specific sequence block to remove it

I made this purely with JavaScript in HTML file without any HTML.
Definitely unnecessary, but I've never done it, so I took on the challenge.
